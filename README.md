# Particle Swarm Optimisation

This project presents a personal implementation of the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm I made. To show its usage, I chose a specifically illustrative example of a **3D space objective point research**. The algorithm "launches" a few particles in the search space, and particles organise themselves to converge towards the objective.

To launch the program and watch the algorithm proceed :  
```
python pso.py
```

The program shall launch a dynamically evolving visualisation that looks like the following screenshot :
